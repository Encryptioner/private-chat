# Task 2: Multi Domain & System Prompt Support - Instructions

## General Rules
1. Assess summary of your earlier tasks in `ai-summaries/task-3-multi-domain-and-system-prompt-support` file if you haven't already. And write or update the summary of your updates in that file when all the current commanded tasks/instructions are done. Keep it short, concise, to-the-point. Include summary of key files changed (with info on functionality changed). You may update it in chronological way by step 1, step 2 and so on. It should reflect the continuos changes done on the codebase.
2. If the instruction lists are not chronological, fix them.
3. You may check other instructions and summaries related to this in `ai-instructions` & `ai-summaries` directory
