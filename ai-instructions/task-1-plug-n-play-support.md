# Task 0: Initial Setup - Instructions

## General Rules
1. Assess summary of your earlier tasks in `ai-summaries/task-1-plug-n-play-support` file if you haven't already. And write or update the summary of your updates in that file when all the current commanded tasks/instructions are done. Keep it short, concise, to-the-point. Include summary of key files changed (with info on functionality changed). You may update it in chronological way by step 1, step 2 and so on. It should reflect the continuos changes done on the codebase.
2. If the instruction lists are not chronological, fix them.
