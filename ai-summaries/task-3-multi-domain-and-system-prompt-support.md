# Task 3: Multi Domain & System Prompt Support - Summary

## Step 1: Context Cache Error Fix

### Issue
The application was experiencing a "Running out of context cache" error when processing larger prompts, specifically:
```
@wllama_wllama_esm.js?v=d74c3d81:2911 Uncaught (in promise) WllamaError: Running out of context cache. Please increase n_ctx when loading the model
```

### Solution
Updated the model loading configuration in `src/App.jsx` to include `n_ctx: 4096` parameter in the options object passed to both `loadModel` and `loadModelFromUrl` methods.

### Files Changed
- **src/App.jsx:90** - Added `n_ctx: 4096` to model loading options to increase context window size for handling longer conversations and larger prompts

### Technical Details
The `n_ctx` parameter controls the context window size in the Wllama WebAssembly LLM inference engine. Increasing it from the default (usually 512-1024) to 4096 allows the model to handle much longer conversation histories and larger system prompts without running out of context cache.

## Step 2: Query Parameter Support for System Messages and Domain Configuration

### Issue
The application needed to support dynamic system messages and domain configuration through query parameters, enabling integration with external websites like the markdown-to-slide project.

### Solution
Implemented end-to-end query parameter support to allow external websites to customize the chat behavior by passing parameters like `system` (for custom system messages) and `domain` through the embed script URL.

### Files Changed
- **src/scripts/embed.ts:12,22-28,61-85** - Added `embedQueryParams` property to store query parameters from embed script URL, and modified `_createIframe()` to forward all query parameters to the iframe
- **src/App.jsx:125-131,490** - Added query parameter parsing using `URLSearchParams` to extract `system` parameter and set custom system message with `setCustomSystemMessage()`. Also updated input maxLength to 4096 to match increased context window

### Integration Flow
1. External websites (like markdown-to-slide) include the embed script with query parameters: `embed.js?system=ENCODED_MESSAGE&domain=DOMAIN_URL`
2. The embed script extracts these parameters from its own URL and forwards them to the iframe
3. The main application reads the parameters via `window.location.search` and applies the custom system message
4. This works across all deployment types: standalone domains, GitHub Pages, and iframe contexts

### Technical Implementation
- Query parameters are URL-encoded for safe transmission
- The embed script uses `URLSearchParams` to parse and forward parameters
- The main app decodes parameters with `decodeURIComponent()`
- All existing functionality remains intact while adding the new parameter support

## Step 3: Enhanced Chat Input and Message Formatting

### Features Implemented

#### 3.1 Ctrl+Enter for New Line Support
**Issue**: The chat input only supported Enter for sending messages, making it difficult to write multi-line prompts.

**Solution**: Modified the `handleOnPressEnter` function to support both:
- `Enter`: Send message (existing behavior)
- `Ctrl+Enter`: Insert new line at cursor position

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:326-347** - Enhanced `handleOnPressEnter` to detect `ctrlKey` modifier and insert new lines with proper cursor positioning

#### 3.2 Improved Chat Input with Character Count
**Issue**: Users had no visibility into how much text they could input and the single-line input was limiting.

**Solution**: Replaced `TextField.Root` with a custom textarea component that includes:
- Multi-line support with auto-resizing (up to 120px max height)
- Character count display (current/4096)
- Better placeholder text indicating Ctrl+Enter functionality
- Proper styling to match the existing design

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:605-694** - Completely replaced TextField component with custom textarea implementation including character counter and auto-resize functionality

#### 3.3 Enhanced Message Formatting and Visual Design
**Issue**: Messages lacked proper formatting for code, links, and had basic visual styling.

**Solution**: Implemented a modern chat bubble interface with:
- **Message Formatting**: Added `formatMessageContent()` function for:
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting headers
  - Inline code formatting
  - Clickable URLs with hover effects
- **Visual Design**: Chat bubble layout similar to ai-chat-interface-web:
  - User messages: Right-aligned with accent color background
  - Assistant messages: Left-aligned with bot avatar (ðŸ¤–) and gray background
  - Rounded corners with tail pointing toward sender
  - Better spacing and typography
- **Enhanced Action Buttons**: Smaller, cleaner read/copy buttons for assistant messages

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:44-65** - Added `formatMessageContent()` function for advanced text processing
- **src/App.jsx:558-659** - Completely redesigned message rendering with chat bubbles, avatars, and improved layout
- **src/index.css:73-166** - Added comprehensive CSS for code blocks, inline code, links, and mobile-responsive styling

### Technical Details
- **Textarea Auto-resize**: Uses `onInput` handler to dynamically adjust height based on content
- **Code Block Formatting**: Detects ```language code``` blocks and formats with headers
- **Link Detection**: Uses regex to find URLs and make them clickable
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized bubble sizes and code block formatting for mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Maintains keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Visual Improvements
- Modern chat bubble design with proper sender/receiver alignment
- Bot avatar for assistant messages
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks with language labels  
- Hover effects on clickable links
- Character count indicator for input limits
- Better mobile responsive design

All features maintain backward compatibility while significantly enhancing the user experience and visual appeal of the chat interface.

## Step 4: Design Refinements and Keyboard Shortcuts Update

### Final Polish and Corrections Applied

**Update**: Changed keyboard shortcut from `Ctrl+Enter` to `Shift+Enter` for new lines as per user feedback.

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:351-375** - Updated `handleOnPressEnter` function to use `e.shiftKey` instead of `e.ctrlKey`
- **src/App.jsx:723** - Updated placeholder text to reflect Shift+Enter shortcut

#### 4.2 Enhanced Input Validation
**Feature**: Added robust validation to ensure users can only send messages containing at least one non-whitespace character.

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:369-372** - Added validation in `handleOnPressEnter` to check for actual words using `/\S/.test(trimmedPrompt)`
- **src/App.jsx:492** - Enhanced `shouldDisableSubmit` logic to prevent submission of empty/whitespace-only messages

#### 4.3 Professional Design System Implementation
**Issue**: Previous chat bubble design needed refinement to better match the application's professional aesthetic.

**Solution**: Implemented a clean, modern design system with:
- **Message Cards**: Replaced chat bubbles with professional card-based design featuring subtle borders and shadows

## Step 5: Final UX Improvements and Polish

### Additional Polish Applied

#### 5.1 Immediate Input Clearing
**Issue**: Chat input was not clearing immediately when a message was sent, creating confusion about whether the message was actually sent.

**Solution**: Modified the `submitPrompt` function to clear the input immediately after starting message generation rather than waiting for completion.

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:309-353** - Restructured `submitPrompt` function to store prompt in `currentPrompt` variable and call `setPrompt("")` immediately after starting generation to provide instant user feedback

#### 5.2 Scrollbar Overlap Fix
**Issue**: Vertical scrollbar in the chat thread was overlapping message text, making content difficult to read and creating poor visual presentation.

**Solution**: Implemented proper spacing and custom scrollbar styling to prevent text overlap:
- Added padding-right to messages container for scrollbar space
- Changed ScrollArea type from "hover" to "scroll" for better visibility
- Implemented custom scrollbar styling with proper colors and hover effects
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness for scrollbar handling

**Files Changed**:
- **src/App.jsx:561-566** - Modified ScrollArea component to use type "scroll" and added proper padding
- **src/index.css:14-48** - Added comprehensive scrollbar styling with proper spacing, colors, and hover effects

## Step 6: Enhanced Scrollbar Visual Spacing

### Final Visual Polish

#### 6.1 Improved Scrollbar Spacing
**Issue**: While the scrollbar no longer overlapped text content, it was positioned too close to the messages, creating a cramped visual appearance.

**Solution**: Increased spacing between content and scrollbar for better visual hierarchy and breathing room:
- Increased padding-right from 12px to 20px on desktop for better separation
- Enhanced scrollbar visual design with increased width (10px) and proper border styling  
- Added margin-right to scrollbar for additional visual separation
- Updated mobile spacing from 8px to 16px for consistent experience across devices
- Improved scrollbar thumb styling with borders and enhanced hover effects

**Files Changed**:
- **src/index.css:14-22** - Increased messages-container padding-right to 20px for improved visual spacing
